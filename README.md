# Google Docs Download (DEPRECATED)

Hi, 

Welcome to one of my older projects (dating back to 2007.) I started this project back when Google Drive was just 
Google Docs and Spreadsheets, and no one was entirely comfortable with the cloud yet.  So I built a tool that allowed
for downloading hard copies of all your documents by scraping data from the Google Docs HTML interface using XPath.
That was fun at the time and it worked pretty nicely, but it has outlived its usefulness and am no longer maintaining
the code for scraping what has become a sophisticated web app (GDrive.)  I had also created a python script that
achieved the same result, but unfortunately the authentication mechanism is no longer supported by Google and I don't
see the same need for these tools anymore.  We have [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com) that works more
effectively and efficiently.  We also have [Google Drive for desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) which is
far more comprehensive.  Plus, we don't give the cloud a second thought anymore.

I've kept the [original website](http://1st-soft.net/gdd/) for GDD available for posterity.

Cheers,

Peter Shafer
