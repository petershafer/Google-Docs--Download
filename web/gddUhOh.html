<h1>Google Doc Download GM Script<br/><img src="emot-frogsiren.gif" alt="Alert!" /> Newly Broken <img src="emot-frogsiren.gif" alt="Alert!" /></h1>

<p>Well, Google Docs has been updated again and this script is no longer working as a result.  The script will be offline until
I have a new, working version ready.  Thanks to everyone who gave me a heads up on this.  Keep an eye on this page and the 
<a href="updates.rss">rss feed</a> for updates.</p>

<h2>How it worked</h2>

<p>Users of Google's document and spreadsheet web service can easily access and manage their important documents in one central location.
They still would like to be able to back up and archive their files on their own systems.  Unfortunately that isn't so easy.  You would
have to open each document and choose to export them individually and becomes quite time consuming if you have more than a handful of
documents. <img src="psy.gif" style="vertical-align:text-top;" alt="emoticon" /></p>

<p>The Google Download Script was written to help streamline this process when combined with a download manager like 
<a href="http://www.downthemall.net">DownThemAll</a>.</p>
